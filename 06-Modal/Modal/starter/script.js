//*******Objectives:

// 1. We will click a button, (that is ''show-modal'' class , there are multiple show-modal so we should use "document.queryselctorAll")
// 2. That will open a modal window that also generate a overlay background

// 3. It will have a cross button to close. Also while clicking on overlay area it will close.

// //*****Implications: */

// 1. To click a button some steps should be completed:
// -We have to store the functionality to "modal" class in a variable,(that is the window going to view).
// -Same as for "overlay,show-modal & close-modal " classes

// 2. We will call the variables to open and close the modals
